## ELECTION PROJECT

This is a web application for election management developed using Laravel ü´•.

This platform provides a comprehensive experience for both voters and administrators ü§ù. For administrators, secure access allows for the creation, modification, and deletion of candidates, electoral programs, and voters, thus offering complete database management üîé.

For voters ü§≥üèª, once authenticated, they can explore a detailed list of candidates with descriptions sourced from the database, as well as associated electoral programs üë§. The voting page, user-friendly and designed with Laravel and Bootstrap, allows voters to make an informed choice. Additionally, integration with Chart.js provides real-time statistics, offering a clear view of voting percentages for each candidate üì∂.
I'm excited to share this achievement, and I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.
